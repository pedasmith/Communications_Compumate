# RS232 Setup for Compumate (Vtech pc3)

## Physical Setup
Setting up an RS-232 serial communications connection can be painful. The connectors have changed over the years, and most PCs no longer come with RS-232 ports. You may need to get serial-to-USB converter.

From the Compumate going to your PC, the required cabling is:

1. Find the 15-pin to 25-pin cable. This is a specialty cable that comes with the Compumate
2. Plug the 15-pin end to the back of the computmate.
3. Optional: connect an RS-232 mini-tester. I use Radio Shart part number 276-1401, but others should also work.
4. Connect a male 25-pin to female 9-pin serial adapter. Mine is the short, solid "block" style.
5. Connect a USB to 9-pin (male) adapter. Mine has the FTDI chipset with a OIKWAN brand

The resuting cable will be long and awkward, which is par for the course with RS-232 these days. The connectors will also pop open if you're not careful.

## Configuring the Compumate

The Communications Program for Compumate will always expects baud rate **9600**, 8 bits, even parity, 1 stop bits, with DTR. To set this up in the compumate, select menu **8** (Communications and Utilites), option **2** (configuration), item **1** (serial upload/download). 

1. The first option is baud rate; select **9600**
2. The second option is the data bits; select 8 bits, 1 stop bit
3. The third option is parity, select even
4. The fourth option is handshake; select none.
