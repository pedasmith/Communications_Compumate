The Communications Program for Compumate can download data from a Compumate LASER pc3 device. It may also work with other Compumate devices.

The Compumate is [menu driven](CompumateMenus.md); the list of programs is on the front. There's a complete [help system](CompumateHelp.md) which has been transcribed.

## Hardware Details

The Compumate uses a 2-line by 20 character LCD display; there's no backlight (or front light, either), which means you must be in a lit room to use the device. It's powered with 4 **AA** cells or with a 12-volt plug-in power supply.

The IO ports
